# Installing Python

*   The Enthought way
    *   One of the easiest ways I've encountered for installing Python + a
        whole bunch of useful packages is through the Enthought distribution.
        This is cross-platform (Mac, Linux, Windows), and is kept pretty well up
        to date. I recommend downloading the 64-bit version of the distribution,
        but to get a link to this download you have to register with them and
        prove that you're a student. You can do that through [this link](http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php).   
*   Other useful Python packages are:
    *   [pyfits](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits/Download) -- Python FITS library
    *   [aplpy](http://aplpy.github.com/) -- The Astronomical Plotting Library
    *   [atpy](http://atpy.github.com/) -- Astronomical Tables
    *   [emcee](emcee.github.com) -- MCMC Ensemble Sampler
